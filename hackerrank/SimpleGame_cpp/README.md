[Problem] (https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/w20/challenges/simple-game)

### Game Rule
- Player divide a pile of stones into x non-empty piles where 2 <= x <= K
- Player who fails to make a move loses
- Game starts with N stones, P1 first, P1 must win

### Thoughts
- Consider an even number N, e.g. 6 into 3 pile, K = 3
    - P1: 4 1 => 3 1 1 1
    - P2: 3 1 1 1 => 2 1 1 1 1
    - P1: 2 1 1 1 1 => 1 1 1 1 1 1
